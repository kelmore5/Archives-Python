## 0.  Example:  Create code that asks a user for a temperature
## in degrees Centigrade and retuns the temperature in degrees Farenheit.
print "Problem 0 Solution:\n"
degreesC = input("Enter a temperature in degrees Centigrade:  ")
print "The temperature", degreesC, "degrees Centigrade is", 1.8*degreesC + 32, "degrees Farenheit.\n"

## 1.  Create code that asks a user for a volume in cubic centimeters
## and which returns the volume in cubic inches.
print "Problem 1 Solution:\n "

## 2.  Create code that prints out a 10X10 square of stars  Make it
## simple and as short as possible.
print "Problem 2 Solution:\n "

## 3.  Create code that asks the user to type in a string and which
## tells how many times the leters x, y and z occur in the string.  Make this
## case-insenstive, i.e. both a and A should count to the total of As.
print "Problem 3 Solution:\n "
x = raw_input("Enter a string:  ")

## 4.  Create a piece of code that asks a user to enter a file name 
## with an extension (example:  cows.txt) and which reports the name
## of the file and the extenion.   You may assume the user will only
## enter a valid name of the form name.
## Here is a sample dialogue.
## 
## Enter a filename:  cows.txt
## The name of the files is cows
## The extension of the file is txt
print "Problem 4 Solution:\n "

## This code will keep asking the user for strings and it puts them
## onto a list named items.  Do not worry about why this code works;
## you will merely be using the list named items it creates and 
## populates
##.
## Uncomment the code in the next few lines to begin work in the next 
## two questions.
##items = []
##current = "x"
##while current != "":
##    current = raw_input("Enter a string; to end just hit ENTER:  ")
##    if current != "":
##        items.append(current)

## 5.  Assuming the user enters at least 4 items that are all lower-case
## words, write code to find and report the second item in alphabetical order.
print "Problem 5 Solution:\n "
## Hint: look up Python list methods; there is a way so sort a list.

## 6.  Assuming the user enters only lower-case words into the list, tell
## how to find and report the words earliest and last in alphabetical order 
print "Problem 6 Solution:\n "

## 7.  Have the computer ask the user for three numbers. Then
## format the numbers in a table datum row in HTML.  Example:
## Enter a number: 2.3
## Enter a number: 3.4
## Enter a number: 4.5
## <tr><td>2.3</td><td>3.4</td><td>4.5</td></tr>
print "Problem 7 Solution:\n "

## 8.  Have the computer ask the user for a date entered in the form
## mm/dd/yyyy.  Have it reply, specifying the month, day and year
##  as integers.
##  Hint: learn about rfind.
##
## Example dialog
## Enter a date as mm/dd/yyyy:  5/5/2001
## The month is 5.
## The day is 5.
## The year is 2001.
## type(month) = <type 'int'>
## type(day) = <type 'int'>
## type(year) = <type 'int'>
print "Problem 8 Solution:\n"
